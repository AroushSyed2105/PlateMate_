Our program is primarily targeted towards a health conscious audience, particularly those who would benefit from convenient 
and personalized meal plans to improve their eating habits. We would particularly consider marketing this program towards
students and working professionals who may not have time but flexibility within their meals. 
With features such as a nutrient tracker, grocery list tracker, and daily challenges to stay healthy, our program
allows users to sustain and improve their health on a simple all-in-one application.

Those who are less health conscious, and those living with a partner or a family are less likely to use our program. The 
first group is simply not our intended audience, while the second group may be interested in utilizing our program, but 
do not find the single person meal plan format practical. As our application uses the ChatGPT API to generate meals, 
there is a lack of ethnic foods generated, which may lead to lack of interest from those who consume those foods regularly
and find comfort in them. The meals generated by the API which do not take into account cost could also result in disinterest 
from those who are not financially well-off from utilizing our program.
